# Personal Website

Personal website I am developing - Expecting to release soon.

Website is currently static to save costs when deploying to AWS but a full backend has been developed using Django.

## Hosting:
The site is hosted statically in AWS using Simple Storage Service (S3) Static Website Hosting.

## Status:
**Still under development - Release expected soon**

## Website V1:
Developed from scratch in the Django Web Framework with a working backend. This site has been replaced by an improved verision (V2) which focused more on making the site static and involved a complete redesign.

## Website V2:
Redesign of the orginal website and was built from scratch mostly to gain more practice with HTML and CSS. This site is completely static as I planned to deploy the site on Amazon S3 using Static Website Hosting.
